# master_thesis

This application was developed as part of the master's thesis "Entwicklung einer Applikation zur Bestimmung von NÃ¤hrwerten in Fotos von Mahlzeiten" ("Development of an Application for Determining Nutritional Values from Meal Photos") and identifies 101 dishes from the Food-101 dataset. The ResNet model used for food identification was trained separately, saved, and loaded into this repository.

Once a dish is identified, the corresponding ingredients are assigned to it, and the calories and nutritional values are displayed per 100g.
